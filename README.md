INFO 314 socket client assignment

## Write a socket client
Create a GitHub repo: SocketClient

Write a Java app that will:
- Connect to a server (command-line parameter) on a port (2nd command-line parameter)
- Take any input passed on the command line (any command-line parameter beyond 2), send it down the socket
- Capture any output from the socket, print it to the console

Demonstrate that it works by connecting to:
- server djxmmx.net / port 17 (Quote of the Day service)
- server time.nist.gov / port 13 (Date-and-Time service)
- server tcpbin.com / port 4242 or 34.230.40.69 / port 30000 (Echo service)

In each case, capture the shell session in a video or text file, and put those files into the GitHub repository containing your code.
